Django + next.js.Why>?
Beacause django does backend very fast and reliable.
Django Ninja makes api faster than many frameworks on the market.
So I make a api that works flawlessly and fast and allow for me to create a seprate Frontend framework allowing for a faster development and potential better flexiblity.

ToDo List:
1.Install and set up Nextjs,create Project
2.Code for navBar
3.Categories On frontPage
